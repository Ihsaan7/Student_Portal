# 🔒 QUICK SECURITY REFERENCE

## ✅ What I've Implemented

### 1. **Middleware Protection** (`middleware.js`)

- ✅ Blocks unauthenticated users from all protected routes
- ✅ Redirects to /login automatically
- ✅ Adds security headers to every response
- ✅ Prevents clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing attacks

### 2. **Security Utilities** (`lib/security.js`)

- ✅ Input sanitization (prevents XSS)
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Strong password enforcement
- ✅ Rate limiting (prevents brute force)
- ✅ File upload validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention

### 3. **Login/Signup Security**

- ✅ Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per minute
- ✅ Rate limiting: 3 signup attempts per minute
- ✅ Email validation before submission
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Input sanitization on all fields

### 4. **Security Headers** (`next.config.mjs`)

- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection
- ✅ Referrer-Policy
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy (in middleware)

### 5. **Database Security** (`security-setup.sql`)

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on ALL tables
- ✅ Users can only see their own data
- ✅ Admins have elevated permissions
- ✅ Storage bucket security
- ✅ Audit logging system
- ✅ Security event tracking

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Install Package ✅

```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr
```

**Status**: Already done!

### Step 2: Run Security SQL

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy entire content of `security-setup.sql`
4. Run it
5. Verify with the check queries at the bottom

### Step 3: Configure Supabase Dashboard

1. **Authentication Settings**:

   - Go to Authentication → Settings
   - Enable "Confirm email" (recommended)
   - Set Site URL: `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Add Redirect URLs

2. **Rate Limiting**:

   - Authentication → Rate Limits
   - Email signups: 10/hour
   - Password logins: 50/hour
   - Password recovery: 5/hour

3. **Email Templates** (optional):
   - Customize confirmation emails
   - Add your branding

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your hosting platform:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Step 5: Test Locally

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

**Test these scenarios**:

- [ ] Can't access /home without logging in
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Signup works
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks after 5 failed logins
- [ ] Can access profile page after login
- [ ] Logout works and redirects to /

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
# Using Vercel (recommended)
vercel

# Or push to GitHub and connect in Vercel dashboard
```

### Step 7: Post-Deployment Tests

1. Visit: https://securityheaders.com (check for A rating)
2. Visit: https://observatory.mozilla.org (check score)
3. Test auth flow on live site
4. Check Supabase logs for errors

## 🛡️ Security Features Explained

### Protection Against:

| Attack Type                           | Protection Method                  | Status                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**        | Input sanitization + CSP headers   | ✅ Protected             |

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test Authentication:

```javascript
// In browser console on your site
// Try to access protected route without login
window.location.href = "/home";
// Should redirect to /login
```

### Test Rate Limiting:

```javascript
// Try logging in 6 times rapidly with wrong password
// Should show "Too many attempts" on 6th try
```

### Test Input Sanitization:

```javascript
// Try entering this in signup name field:
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
// Should be cleaned/blocked
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring (After Deploy)

### Supabase Dashboard:

- Check "API" tab for request patterns
- Monitor "Authentication" for failed logins
- Review "Database" logs for queries

### Vercel Analytics (if using Vercel):

- Monitor page load times
- Track error rates
- View geographic distribution

### Set Up Alerts:

1. Multiple failed logins from same IP
2. Unusual database query patterns
3. High error rates
4. Sudden traffic spikes

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If You Detect an Attack:

**Immediate Response**:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable logins (Supabase SQL Editor)
UPDATE auth.config
SET value = 'false'
WHERE key = 'enable_signup';
```

**Lock User Account**:

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard
-- Authentication → Users → Select user → Disable
```

**Review Logs**:

1. Supabase → Logs → Check recent activity
2. Look for unusual patterns
3. Check IP addresses

**Recovery**:

1. Patch vulnerability
2. Force password reset for affected users
3. Clear sessions
4. Re-enable system

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Middleware not working

**Solution**: Check `middleware.js` is in root directory (same level as `app/`)

### Issue: Users can still access protected routes

**Solution**:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Verify `middleware.js` export config is correct
3. Check Supabase auth is working

### Issue: RLS denying all access

**Solution**:

```sql
-- Check policies exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Verify user ID matches
SELECT auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Rate limiting not working

**Solution**: Clear browser localStorage/sessionStorage

### Issue: Build fails

**Solution**:

```bash
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```
